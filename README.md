# About LRR

LRR (Lab Report Repository) is an online software application for posting assignments, submitting assignments and marking (re-marking) assignments.

This software was originally developed by by Mahomed Nor, a postgraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the Zhejiang Normal University,
while he was taking his graduate course Advanced Software Engineering (http://lanlab.org/course/2018f/se/homepage.html).



# Mission

Our mission is to make the learning experience great for tens of thousands of students around the world.



# Current Status

This software has been actively used by students who took or are taking courses taught by Hui.  There are more than 200 student accounts created since its first launch.

A running instance of this software is at http://118.25.96.118/nor/

There are about 40 bugs (most are CRITICAL) that remain unresolved before LRR can hit its beta release.  See the section Bug Tracker for more details.

Currently, there are a few groups (formed by students who are taking Software Project Management) working on these bugs.
