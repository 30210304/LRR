CURRENT PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED
1.  a new user could not login immediately after sign-up. (SOLVED)
2.  password resetting link is not always sent successfully.
3. creating sub-directories on all student submissions course-code/semester/section-number.  (/student-number/course-code/semester/section-number/assignement-title/submission.txt)
4. editing the assignment title after uploading a new assignment (instructor).

More improvements are welcome
